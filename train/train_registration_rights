The Purchaser also acknowledges that the Notes will bear a legend substantially
in the form included in the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A. The
legends contained on the Notes and the certificates representing TMRC Converted
Shares shall be removed by the Company upon delivery to it of an opinion of
counsel to the Company (which opinion and counsel rendering same shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company) that a registration statement under the
Securities Act is at the time effective with respect to the transfer of the
legended security or that such security may be transferred without such
registration statement being in effect and without the requirements of a legend
on the certificate in the hands of the transferee.

REGISTRATION
Demand Rights. On three occasions during the period
ending on the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement and on one
occasion after the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the
Purchaser may request in writing (on behalf of itself and all of its Affiliates
to whom rights under this Agreement have been assigned pursuant to Section 9.1
and in the aggregate as a group) to the Company (a "Demand Request"), pursuant
to this Section 8.1, that the Company register under the Securities Act any
TMRC Converted Shares owned by the Purchaser and its Affiliates pursuant to a
non-underwritten offering, having a period of distribution not to exceed 60
days; provided, however, the Company shall not be obligated to prepare and file
any registration statement pursuant to this Section 8.1, or prepare or file any
amendment or supplement thereto, and may suspend sales thereunder, at any time
when the Company reasonably believes that the filing thereof at the time
requested, or the offering of securities pursuant thereto, would materially and
adversely affect a pending or proposed public offering of securities of the
Company, a proposed acquisition, merger, recapitalization, consolidation, reorganization or similar
transaction relating to the Company or negotiations, discussions or pending
proposals with respect thereto or require premature disclosure of information
not otherwise required to be disclosed to the potential detriment of the
Company; provided, however, that such period of sale or distribution shall
resume after any such suspension for a number of additional days necessary so
that such registration has been kept effective for permitted sales thereunder
for an aggregate term of 60 days. In the event the filing of a registration
statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, by the Company is deferred,
or the sale and distribution of shares is suspended, in each case pursuant to
the foregoing provisions, for more than 15 business days, then the Purchaser
(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) may (only in the event the Purchaser
or its Affiliates have not yet sold more than 50% of the TMRC Converted Shares
owned by any of them that are included in the registration statement) give the
Company written notice of the Purchaser's and its Affiliates' intent to abandon
the registration, and, in such circumstance, no additional TMRC Converted
Shares owned by the Purchaser or its Affiliates may be sold by the Purchaser or
its Affiliates pursuant to such registration statement and the registration or
request for registration shall not be considered one of the Purchaser's and its
Affiliates' Demand Requests permitted by this Section 8.1. Any Demand Request
made by the Purchaser (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) during the
period ending on the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement must be
for registration of a minimum of 250,000 shares of TMRC Converted Shares owned
by the Purchaser or its Affiliates. Any Demand Request made by the Purchaser
(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) at any time after the first
anniversary of the date of this Agreement must be for registration of a minimum
of 500,000 shares of TMRC Converted Shares owned by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates. The filing of a registration statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, by the Company may not be deferred, and the sale and
distribution of shares may not be suspended, in each case pursuant to the
foregoing provisions, for more than 60 days after the abandonment or
consummation (or the completion of the distribution of securities in the case
of a public offering) of any of the proposals or transactions described therein
or, in any event, for more than 180 days during any one year.

Registration of Shares.  Goodrich-Delaware  shall file with the
SEC within  sixty (60) days  following  the Date of Note  hereof a  registration
statement  on Form S-1 under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended,  or such
other form that the Company is eligible to use or that the SEC deems appropriate
(the "Registration  Statement") for the registration of the resale by the Lender
of the common stock of  Goodrich-Delaware  issuable upon conversion of this Note
("Registrable  Securities").  The Company shall use its best efforts to have the
Registration  Statement  declared  effective  by the SEC by no later than ninety
(90) days  after the Date of Note  hereof  and to ensure  that the  Registration
Statement,  and the underlying prospectus,  remains in effect for so long as any
Registrable Shares are outstanding.

               (a)  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Goodrich-Delaware  may defer
the filing of the Registration  Statement until a date not later than sixty (60)
days after the time set forth above if Goodrich-Delaware or its subsidiaries are
engaged in confidential  negotiations or other confidential business activities,
disclosure of which would be required in such Registration  Statement (but would
not be required if such Registration Statement were not filed).

               (b)   Notwithstanding   the   foregoing,   if   Goodrich-Delaware
determines  in its good  faith  judgment  that the filing of any  supplement  or
amendment  to the  Registration  Statement  in order  to keep  the  Registration
Statement  effective would require the disclosure of material  information  that
Goodrich-Delaware   has  a  bona  fide  business   purpose  for   preserving  as
confidential,    then   upon   written   notice   of   such   determination   by
Goodrich-Delaware   to  the  Lender,  the  obligation  of  Goodrich-Delaware  to
supplement  or  amend  the  Registration   Statement  will  be  suspended  until
Goodrich-Delaware notifies the Lender in writing that the reasons for suspension
of such obligations no longer exist and Goodrich-Delaware  amends or supplements
the Registration Statement as may be required. The maximum number of consecutive
days during which  Goodrich-Delaware may delay the filing of any such supplement
or amendment shall not exceed sixty (60) days.
