Reclassification, Reorganization, Consolidation or Merger. In
the case of any  reclassification  of the Common Stock,  or any  reorganization,
consolidation or merger of  Goodrich-Delaware  with or into another  corporation
(other than a merger or reorganization  with respect to which  Goodrich-Delaware
is the continuing  corporation and which does not result in any reclassification
of the Common  Stock),  each share of Common  Stock  theretofore  issuable  upon
exercise of any Conversion  Option,  shall be properly adjusted as to the number
and kind of securities  receivable  upon the exercise of any Conversion  Option,
such that Lender shall receive the number and kind of securities  which a holder
of Common Stock would have been  entitled to receive  after the happening of any
of the events  described in this  subsection (a) had the conversion  pursuant to
any Conversion Option been made immediately prior to the happening of such event
or the record date for such event,  whichever is earlier. The provisions of this
subsection   (a)  shall   similarly   apply  to  successive   reclassifications,
reorganizations, consolidations or mergers.

Split,   Subdivision   or   Combination   of   Shares.   If
Goodrich-Delaware  at any time  prior to  Lender's  exercise  of any  Conversion
Option shall split,  subdivide or combine the Common Stock of Goodrich-Delaware,
the Conversion Price shall be  proportionately  decreased in the case of a split
or subdivision or  proportionately  increased in the case of a combination.  Any
adjustment  under this  subsection  (b) shall become  effective  when the split,
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

Provisions in Case of Consolidation, Merger or Sale of
Assets. In case of any consolidation of the Borrower with, or merger of the
Borrower into, any Person, or in case of any merger of another Person into the
Borrower (other than a consolidation or merger which does not result in any
reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of
Common Stock), or in case of any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Borrower, the Person formed by such consolidation or resulting
from such merger or which acquires such assets, as the case may be, shall agree
and provide or cause provision to be made that a Holder shall have the right
thereafter, during the period this Note shall be convertible, to convert this
Note into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable
upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock into which this Note might have been converted
immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, assuming such
holder of Common Stock (i) is not a Person with which the Borrower consolidated
or into which the Borrower merged or which merged into the Borrower or to which
such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (a "CONSTITUENT PERSON"), or
an Affiliate of a Constituent Person and (ii) failed to exercise such Person's
rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and
other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer
(provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property
receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer is not the same for
each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such consolidation, merger,
sale or transfer by other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and
in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised
("non-electing share"), then for the purpose of this paragraph (r) the kind and
amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon
such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer by each non-electing share shall be
deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of
non-electing shares). The above provisions of this paragraph (r) shall similarly
apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales or transfers.

(e) "**Change of Control** means any Fundamental Transaction other than (i)
any reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of the Common Stock
in which holders of the Company's voting power immediately prior to such
reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification continue after such
reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification to hold publicly traded
securities and, directly or indirectly, the voting power of the surviving
entity or entities necessary to elect a majority of the members of the board
of directors (or their equivalent if other than a corporation) of such entity
or entities, or (ii) pursuant to a migratory merger effected solely for the
purpose of changing the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company.
